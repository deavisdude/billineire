# Village Overhaul Configuration
# ===================================
# Configure village generation, spacing, terrain handling, and debug options

# Village Generation Settings
village:
  # Minimum spacing between building footprints (blocks)
  # This prevents structures from being placed too close together
  # Default: 2 blocks (Constitution v1.5.0, Principle XII)
  minBuildingSpacing: 2
  
  # Minimum spacing between village borders (blocks)
  # Enforces border-to-border distance; prevents village overlap
  # First/early villages start near (not at) spawn; subsequent villages
  # placed as close as possible to existing borders while respecting this distance
  # Default: 200 blocks (Constitution v1.5.0, Principle XII)
  minVillageSpacing: 200
  
  # Maximum radius for spawn-proximal first village placement (blocks)
  # First village will be placed within this distance from world spawn
  # Set to 0 to disable spawn proximity bias
  # Default: 512 blocks (Constitution v1.5.0, Principle XII)
  spawnProximityRadius: 512

# Debug Flags
debug:
  # Enable detailed tick engine logging
  tick: false
  
  # Enable structure placement debug logs
  structure: false
  
  # Enable path generation debug logs
  path: false
